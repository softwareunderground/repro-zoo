### Abstract

Based on reflective properties, a thin bed may be conveniently defined as one whose thickness is less than about 𝜆𝑏/8 where 𝜆𝑏 is the (predominant) wavelength computed using the velocity of the bed. The amplitude of a reflection from a thin bed is to the first order of approximation equal to 4𝜋Ab/𝜆𝑏, where b is the thickness of the bed and A is the amplitude of the reflection if the bed were to be very thick. The equation shows that a bed as thin as 10 ft has, for typical frequency and velocity, considerably more reflective power than is usually attributed to it.
